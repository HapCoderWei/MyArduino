Playing around with a 6DOF IMU (MPU-6050), Arduino, Python and OpenGL

The Arduino Uno is sending pitch and roll data via bluetooth. A python script is receiving the data and displaying a little cube accordingly. The IMU data consists of gyro and accelerometer data, processed by a complementary filter.
